Bingrep allows you to find a binary expresion into a file, or files, by searching recursively in a directory tree. You do not depend on file extensions anymore. You can find any file for its type, Bingrep will find it looking for binary patterns into the file.
You could use Bingrep for binary audit purposes as well.
